# Innovation Workshop

Design a great user experience does not have to be a lengthy process. We can prototype Alexa apps quickly. Divide into groups of 4 to 5 and follow the prompts below

1. Who are our stake holders? (5 mins)
2. What problems do they have? (5 mins)
3. What questions might they ask to solve those problems? (5 mins)
4. Prototype your experience (15) 
  * Pick a group member to act as your Alexa Skill. 
  * Pick another group member to be the questioner. 
  * Practice your questions and answers. 
  * Take notes about any datasets or additional resources you may need to support your Alexa Skill. For example, did you need to google something to find an answer? If so, make a note of that.
